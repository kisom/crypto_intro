        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Recently at work I have been using the
<a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a> libraries quite
a bit. The documentation is pretty good, but there are a few areas
that took me a bit to figure out. In this post, I’ll be writing up
a quick overview of the PyCrypto library and cover some general
things to know when writing cryptographic code in general. I’ll go
over symmetric, public-key, hybrid, and message authentication
codes. Keep in mind this is a quick introduction and a lot of gross
simplifications are made. For a more complete introduction to
cryptography, take a look at the references at the end of this
article. This article is just an appetite-whetter - if you have a
real need for information security you should hire an expert. Real
data security goes beyond this quick introduction (you wouldn’t
trust the design and engineering of a bridge to a student with a
quick introduction to civil engineering, would you?)</p>

<p>Some quick terminology: for those unfamiliar, I introduce the following
terms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>plaintext: the original message</p></li>
<li><p>ciphertext: the message after cryptographic transformations are
applied to obscure the original message.</p></li>
<li><p>encrypt: producing ciphertext by applying cryptographic transformations
to plaintext.</p></li>
<li><p>decrypt: producing plaintext by applying cryptographic transformations
to ciphertext.</p></li>
<li><p>cipher: a particular set of cryptographic transformations providing
means of both encryption and decryption.</p></li>
<li><p>hash: a set of cryptographic transformations that take a large
input and transform it to a unique (typically fixed-size) output.
For hashes to be cryptographically secure, collisions should be
practically nonexistent. It should be practically impossible to
determine the input from the output.</p></li>
</ul><p>Cryptography is an often misunderstood component of information
security, so an overview of what it is and what role it plays is in
order. There are four major roles that cryptography plays:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>confidentiality: ensuring that only the intended recipients receive
the plaintext of the message.</p></li>
<li><p>data integrity: the plaintext message arrives unaltered.</p></li>
<li><p>entity authentication: the identity of the sender is verified.
An entity may be a person or a machine.</p></li>
<li><p>message authentication: the message is verified as having been
unaltered.</p></li>
</ul><p>Note that cryptography is used to obscure the contents of a message and
verify its contents and source. It will <strong>not</strong> hide the fact that two
entities are communicating.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of ciphers: symmetric and public-key ciphers.
A symmetric key cipher employs the use of shared secret keys. They also
tend to be much faster than public-key ciphers. A public-key cipher is
so-called because each key consists of a private key which is used to
generate a public key. Like their names imply, the private key is kept
secret while the public key is passed around. First, I’ll take a look at
a specific type of symmetric ciphers: block ciphers.</p>

<h1>Block Ciphers</h1>

<p>There are two further types of symmetric keys: stream and block
ciphers.  Stream ciphers operate on data streams, i.e. one byte at
a time. Block ciphers operate on blocks of data, typically 16 bytes
at a time. The most common block cipher and the standard one you
should use unless you have a very good reason to use another one
is the
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
block cipher, also documented in <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">FIPS PUB
197</a>. AES
is a specific subset of the Rijndael cipher. AES uses block size
of 128-bits (16 bytes); data should be padded out to fit the block
size - the length of the data block must be multiple of the block
size. For example, given an input of <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCDABCD</code>
no padding would need to be done.  However, given <code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD
ABCDABCDABCD</code> an additional 4 bytes of padding would need to be
added. A common padding scheme is to use <code>0x80</code> as the first byte
of padding, with <code>0x00</code> bytes filling out the rest of the padding.
With padding, the previous example would look like:
<code>ABCDABCDABCDABCD ABCDABCDABCD\x80\x00\x00\x00</code>.</p>

<p>Writing a padding function is pretty easy:</p>

<pre><code>    def pad_data(data):
        # return data if no padding is required
        if len(data) % 16 == 0: 
            return data

        # subtract one byte that should be the 0x80
        # if 0 bytes of padding are required, it means only
        # a single \x80 is required.

        padding_required     = 15 - (len(data) % 16)

        data = '%s\x80' % data
        data = '%s%s' % (data, '\x00' * padding_required)

        return data
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, removing padding is also easy:</p>

<pre><code>    def unpad_data(data):
        if not data: 
            return data

        data = data.rstrip('\x00')
        if data[-1] == '\x80':
            return data[:-1]
        else:
            return data
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve included these functions in the example code for this tutorial.</p>

<p>Encryption with a block cipher requires selecting a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Block%20cipher%0Amodes%20of%20operation">block
mode</a>. By far the most common mode used is <strong>cipher
block chaining</strong> or <em>CBC</em> mode. Other modes include <em>counter (CTR)</em>,
<em>cipher feedback (CFB)</em>, and the extremely insecure <em>electronic
codebook (ECB)</em>. CBC mode is the standard and is well-vetted, so I
will stick to that in this tutorial.  Cipher block chaining works
by XORing the previous block of ciphertext with the current block.
You might recognise that the first block has nothing to be XOR’d
with; enter the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Initialization_vector"><em>initialisation
vector</em></a>.
This comprises a number of randomly-generated bytes of data the
same size as the cipher’s block size. This initialisation vector
should be random enough that it cannot be recovered. One manner of
doing this is to combine a standard UNIX timestamp with a block-size
group of random data, using a standard hashing algorithm such as
SHA1 to make it unique.</p>

<p>One of the most critical components to encryption is properly
generating random data. Fortunately, most of this is handled by the
PyCrypto library’s <code>Crypto.Random.OSRNG module</code>. You should know
that the more entropy sources that are available (such as network
traffic and disk activity), the faster the system can generate
cryptographically-secure random data. I’ve written a function that
can generate a
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce"><em>nonce</em></a>
suitable for use as an initialisation vector. This will work on a
UNIX machine; the comments note how easy it is to adapt it to a
Windows machine. This function requires a version of PyCrypto at
least 2.1.0 or higher.</p>

<pre><code>    import time
    import Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix

    def generate_nonce():
        rnd = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
        rnd = '%s%s' % (rnd, str(time.time()))
        nonce = Crypto.Hash.MD5.new(data = rnd)

        return nonce.digest()
</code></pre>

<p>I will note here that the python `random` module is completely
unsuitable for cryptography (as it is completely deterministic). You
shouldn’t use it for cryptographic code.</p>

<p>Symmetric ciphers are so-named because the key is shared across any
entities. There are three key sizes for AES: 128-bit, 192-bit, and
256-bit, aka 16-byte, 24-byte, and 32-byte key sizes. If you want to use
a passphrase, you should use a digest algorithm that produces an
appropriately sized digest and hash that passphrase. For example, for
AES-256, you would want to use SHA-256. Here is a sample function to
generate an AES-256 key from a passphrase:</p>

<pre><code>    # generate an AES-256 key from a passphrase
    def passphrase(password, readable = False):
        """
        Converts a passphrase to a format suitable for use as an AES key.

        If readable is set to True, the key is output as a hex digest. This is
        suitable for sharing with users or printing to screen when debugging
        code.

        By default readable is set to False, in which case the value it 
        returns is suitable for use directly as an AES-256 key.
        """
        key     = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(password)

        if readable:
            return key.hexdigest()
        else:
            return key.digest()
</code></pre>

<p>We could include this a set of AES encryption and decryption functions:</p>

<pre><code>     mode = Crypto.Cipher.AES.MODE_CBC       # shortcut to clean up code

     # AES-256 encryption using a passphrase
     def passphrase_encrypt(password, iv, data):
        key     = passphrase(password)
        data    = pad_data(data)
        aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)

        return aes.encrypt(data)

    # AES-256 decryption using a passphrase
    def passphrase_decrypt(password, iv, data):
        key     = passphrase(password)
        aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
        data    = aes.decrypt(data)

        return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the data is padded before being encrypted and unpadded after
decryption - the decryption process will not remove the padding on its
own.</p>

<p>Of course, storing the password is another matter entirely; I
recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pbkdf2">PBKDF2</a>. Other
options include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>. For symmetric
ciphers, it is better to use a completely randomly generated password.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pbkdf2/"><code>pbkdf2</code> package</a> in PyPI
is a Python implementation of PBKDF2.  The example from the <a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/python-pbkdf2/">package's
webpage</a> is very
clear:</p>

<pre><code>    from PBKDF2 import PBKDF2
        from Crypto.Cipher import AES
        import os

        salt = os.urandom(8)    # 64-bit salt
        key = PBKDF2("This passphrase is a secret.", salt).read(32) # 256-bit key
        iv = os.urandom(16)     # 128-bit IV
        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you are you doing interactive encryption, passphrase encryption
won’t be terribly useful. Instead, we just need to generate 32 random
bytes (and make sure we keep track of it) and use that as the key:</p>

<pre><code>    # generate a random AES-256 key
    def generate_aes_key():
        rnd     = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read(KEY_SIZE)
        return rnd
</code></pre>

<p>We can use this key directly in the AES transformations:</p>

<pre><code>    def encrypt(key, iv, data):
        aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
        data    = pad_data(data)

        return aes.encrypt(data)

    def decrypt(key, iv, data):
        aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
        data    = aes.decrypt(data)

        return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<p>That should cover the basics of block cipher encryption. We’ve gone over
key generation, padding, and encryption / decryption. AES-256 isn’t the
only block cipher provided by the PyCrypto package; however, it is the
standard and well-vetted.</p>

<h1>ASCII-Armouring</h1>

<p>I’m going to take a quick detour and talk about ASCII armouring.
If you’ve played with the crypto functions above, you’ll notice
they produce an annoying dump of binary data that can be a hassle
to deal with. One common technique for making the data a little bit
easier to deal with is to encode it with
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Base64">base64</a>.
There are a few ways to incorporate this into python:</p>

<h2>Absolute Base64 Encoding</h2>

<p>The easiest way is to just base64 encode everything in the encrypt
function. Everything that goes into the decrypt function should be in
base64 - if it’s not, the <code>base64</code> module will throw an error: you could
catch this and then try to decode it as binary data.</p>

<h2>A Simple Header</h2>

<p>A slightly more complex option, and the one I adopt in this article, is
to use a <code>\x00</code> as the first byte of the ciphertext for binary data, and
to use <code>\x41</code> (an ASCII “<code>A</code>”) for ASCII encoded data. This will
increase the complexity of the encryption and decryption functions
slightly. We’ll also pack the initialisation vector at the beginning of
the file as well. Given now that the <code>iv</code> argument might be <code>None</code> in
the decrypt function, I will have to rearrange the arguments a bit; for
consistency, I will move it in both functions. I leave adding it into
the <code>passphrase_encrypt</code> and <code>passphrase_decrypt</code> functions as an
exercise for the reader. My modified functions look like this now:</p>

<pre><code>    def encrypt(key, data, iv, armour = False):
        aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
        data    = pad_data(data)
        ct      = aes.encrypt(data)         # ciphertext
        ct      = iv + ct                   # pack the initialisation vector in

        # ascii-armouring
        if armour:
            ct = '\x41' + base64.encodestring(ct)
        else:
            ct = '\x00' + ct

        return ct

    def decrypt(key, data, iv = None):
        # remove ascii-armouring if present
        if data[0] == '\x00':
            data = data[1:]
        elif data[0] == '\x41':
            data = base64.decodestring(data[1:])

        iv      = data[:16]
        data    = data[16:]
        aes     = Crypto.Cipher.AES.new(key, mode, iv)
        data    = aes.decrypt(data)
        return unpad_data(data)
</code></pre>

<h2>A More Complex Container</h2>

<p>There are more complex ways to do it (and you’ll see it with the public
keys in the next section) that involve putting the base64 into a
container of sorts that contains additional information about the key.</p>

<h1>Public Key Cryptography</h1>

<p>Now it is time to take a look at public-key cryptography. Public-key
cryptography, or PKC, involves the use of two-part keys. The private key
is the sensitive key that should be kept private by the owning entity,
whereas the public key (which is generated from the private key) is
meant to be distributed to any entities which must communicate securely
with the entity owning the private key. Confusing? Let’s look at this
using the venerable Alice and Bob, patron saints of cryptography.</p>

<p>Alice wants to talk to Bob, but doesn’t want Eve to know the contents of
the message. Both Alice and Bob generate a set of private keys. From
those private keys, they both generate public keys. Let’s say they post
their public keys on their websites. Alice wants to send a private
message to Bob, so she looks up Bob’s public key from his site. (In
fact, there is a way to distribute keys via a central site or entity;
this is called a public key infrastructure (PKI)). The public key can be
used as the key to encrypt a message with PKC. The resulting ciphertext
can only be decrypted using Bob’s private key. Alice sends Bob the
resulting ciphertext, which Eve cannot decrypt without Bob’s private
key. Hopefully this is a little less confusing.</p>

<p>One of the most common PKC systems is RSA (which is an acronym for
the last names of the designers of the algorithm). Generally, RSA
keys are 1024-bit, 2048-bit, or 4096-bits long. The keys are most
often in
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Privacy-enhanced%0AElectronic%20Mail">PEM</a> or
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Distinguished%20Encoding%0ARules">DER</a> format. Generating RSA keys with PyCrypto is extremely easy:</p>

<pre><code>    def generate_key(size):
        PRNG    = Crypto.Random.OSRNG.posix.new().read
        key     = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.generate(size, PRNG)

        return key
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>key</code> that is returned isn’t like the keys we used with the block
ciphers. It is an RSA object and comes with several useful built-in
methods. One of these is the <code>size()</code> method, which returns the size of
the key in bits minus one. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; import publickey
    &gt;&gt;&gt; key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
    &gt;&gt;&gt; key.size()
    1023
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A quick note: I will use 1024-bit keys in this tutorial because they are
faster to generate, but in practice you should be using at least
2048-bit keys. The key also includes encryption and decryption methods
in the class:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; import publickey
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import base64
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = 'Test message...'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ciphertext = key.encrypt(message, None)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print base64.encodestring(ciphertext[0])
    gzA9gXfHqnkValdhhYjRVVSxuygx48i66h0vFUnmVu8FZXJtmaACvNDo43D0vjjHzFiblE1eCFiI
    xlhVuHxldWXJSnARgWX1bTY7imR9Hve+WQC8rl+qB5xpq3xnKH7/z8/5YdLvCo/knXYE1cI/XYJP
    EP1nA6bUZNj6bD1Zx4w=
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>None</code> that is passed into the encryption function is part of the
PyCrypto API for those public key ciphers requiring an additional random
number function to be passed in. It returns a tuple containing only the
encrypted message. In order to pass this to the decryption function, we
need to pass only the encrypted message as a string:</p>

<pre><code>     &gt;&gt;&gt; ciphertext = key.encrypt(message, None)[0]
     &gt;&gt;&gt; key.decrypt(ciphertext)
     'Test message...'
</code></pre>

<p>While these are simple enough, we could put them into a pair of
functions that also include ASCII-armouring:</p>

<pre><code>    def encrypt(key, message, armour = True):
        ciphertext  = key.encrypt( message, None )
        ciphertext  = ciphertext[0]

        if armour:
            ciphertext = '\x41' + base64.encodestring( ciphertext )
        else:
            ciphertext = '\x00' + base64.encodestring( ciphertext )

        return ciphertext

    def decrypt(key, message):
        if   '\x00' == message[0]:
            message = message[1:]
        elif '\x41' == message[0]:
            message == base64.decodestring( message[1:] )

        plaintext   = key.decrypt( message )
        return plaintext
</code></pre>

<p>These two functions present a common API that will simplify encryption
and decryption and make it a little easier to read. Assuming we still
have the same <code>message</code> definition as before:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; ciphertext = publickey.encrypt(key, message)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; publickey.decrypt(key, ciphertext)
    'Test message...'
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what if we want to export this generated key and read it in later?
The key comes with the method <code>exportKey()</code>. If the key is a private
key, it will export the private key; if it is a public key, it will
export the public key. We can write functions to backup our private key
(which <strong>absolutely</strong> needs to be kept secure) and a function to export
our public key, suitable for uploading to our web page or to a PKI
keystore:</p>

<pre><code>    # backup our key, whether public or private
    def export_key(filename, key):
        try:
            f = open(filename, 'w')
        except IOError as e:
            print e
            raise
        else:
            f.write( key.exportKey() )
            f.close()

    # will only export the public key
    def export_pubkey(filename, key):
        try:
            f = open(filename, 'w')
        except IOError as e:
            print e
            raise
        else:
            f.write( key.publickey().exportKey() )
            f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Importing a key is done using the RSA.importKey function:</p>

<pre><code>    def load_key(filename):
        try:
            f = open(filename)
        except IOError as e:
            print e
            raise
        else:
            key = Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.importKey(f.read())
            f.close()
        return key
</code></pre>

<p>We can take a look at the difference between the public and private
keys:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print key.exportKey()
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

<p>Using the <code>export_pubkey()</code> function, you can pass that file around to
people to encrypt messages to you. Often, you wil want to generate a
keypair to give to people. One convention is to name the secret key
’keyname.prv’ (prv for private) and the public key ’keyname.pub’. We
will follow that convention in an <code>export_keypair()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>    def export_keypair(basename, key):
        pubkeyfile   = basename + '.pub'
        prvkeyfile   = basename + '.prv'

        export_key(prvkeyfile, key)
        export_pubkey(pubkeyfile, key)
</code></pre>

<p>For example, Bob generates a keypair and emails the public key to Alice:</p>

<pre><code>     &gt;&gt;&gt; key = publickey.generate_key( 1024 )
     &gt;&gt;&gt; key.size()
     1023
     &gt;&gt;&gt; key.has_private()
     True
     &gt;&gt;&gt; publickey.export_keypair('bob.prv', key)
     &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Then, assuming Bob gave Alice <code>bob.pub</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; bob = publickey.load_key('./bobpub')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; message = 'secret message from Alice to Bob'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print publickey.encrypt(bob, message)
    AN6RsuXEeKicUZKtZCsDeqGKeB5em+NG/bgoqr9l8ij2o1Gr9sT69tv0zxgmigK/Jt+gPxg/EDu61
    nHmAK0XQV7BvJS5jLuBxdJ0mEpysVClu46XN1KHU2l2DsGht9e8OFvhEfDkI5t/cy/gXr0xz/EUi
    rqo8qLd9Mw6TerM8gs8=
</code></pre>

<p>The ASCII-armoured format makes it convenient for Alice to paste the
encrypted message to Bob, so she does, and now Bob has it on his
computer. To read it, he does something similar:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; bob = publickey.load_key('tests/bob.prv')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print publickey.decrypt(bob, message)
    secret message from Alice to Bob
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, Bob can’t be sure that the message came from Alice but he
can read the message. We’ll cover entity authentication in a later
section, but first, there’s something else I’d to point out:</p>

<p>You might have noticed at this point that public key cryptography
appears to be a lot simpler than symmetric key cryptography. The
key distribution problem is certainly easier, especially with a
proper PKI.  Why would anyone choose to use symmetric key cryptography
over public key cryptography? The answer is performance: if you
compare the block cipher test code (if you don’t have a copy of
this code, you can get it at the <a href="https://github.com/kisom/crypto_intro">tutorial’s github
page</a>) with the public key
test code, you will notice that the block cipher code is orders of
magnitude faster. It also generates far more keys than the public
key code. There is a solution to this problem: hybrid cryptosystems.</p>

<p>Hybrid cryptosystems use public key cryptography to establish a
symmetric session key. Both
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"><strong>TLS</strong></a>
(Transport Layer Security), and its predecessor <strong>SSL</strong> (Secure
Sockets Layer), most often used to secure HTTP transactions, use a
hybrid cryptosystem to speed up establishing a secure session.  PGP
(and hence GnuPG) also uses hybrid crypto.</p>

<p>Let’s say Alice and Bob wish to use hybrid crypto. If Alice initiates
the session, she should be the one to generate the session key. For
example,</p>

<pre><code>     &gt;&gt;&gt; import block, publickey
     &gt;&gt;&gt; session_key = block.generate_aes_key()
     &gt;&gt;&gt; alice_key   = publickey.load_key('keys/alice.prv')
     &gt;&gt;&gt; bob_key     = publickey.load_key('keys/bob.pub')
     &gt;&gt;&gt; encrypted_session_key = encrypt( bob_key, session_key )
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, Alice should send Bob the <code>encrypted_session_key</code>; she
should retain a copy as well. They can then use this key to communicate
using the much-faster AES256.</p>

<p>In communicating, it might be wise to create a message format that packs
in the session key into a header, and encrypts the rest of the body with
the session key. This is a subject beyond the realm of a quick tutorial</p>

<ul>
<li>again, consult with the people who do this on a regular basis.</li>
</ul><h1>Digital Signatures</h1>

<p>In all of the previous examples, we assumed that the identity of the
sender wasn’t a question. For a symmetric key, that’s less of a stretch</p>

<ul>
<li>there’s no differentiation between owners. Public keys, however, are
supposed to be associated with an entity. How can we prove the identity
of the user? Without delving into too much into social sciences and
trust metrics and a huge philosophical argument, let’s look at the
basics of signatures.</li>
</ul><p>A signature works similarly to encryption, but in reverse, and it is
slightly different: a hash of the message is ’encrypted’ by the private
key to the public key. The public key is used to ’decrypt’ this
ciphertext. Contrast this to actual public key encryption: the entire
message is encrypted to the private key by the public key, and the
private key is used to decrypt the ciphertext. With signatures, the
’encrypted’ hash of the message is called the signature, and the act of
’encryption’ is termed ’signing’. Similarly, the ’decryption’ is known
as verification or verifying the signature.</p>

<p>PyCrypto’s PublicKey implementations already come with signatures and
verification methods for keys using sign() and verify(). The signature
is a long in a tuple:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; key.sign( d, None )
    (1738423518152671545669571445860037944518162197656333123466248015147955424248
876723731383711018550231967374810686606623315483033485630977014574359346192927942
623807461783144628656796225504478196458051789241311033020911767301220653148276004
0551357526383627059382081878791040169815009051016949220178044764130908L,)
</code></pre>

<p>We can write our own functions to wrap around these two functions and
perform ASCII-armouring if desired. Our signature function should take a
key and a message, and optionally a flag to ASCII armour the signature;
it should return a signed digest of the message:</p>

<pre><code>    def sign(key, message, armour = True):
        if not key.can_sign(): 
            return None

        digest      = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(message).digest()
        signature   = key.sign( digest, None )[0]

        if armour:
            sig     = base64.encodestring( str(signature) )
        else:
            sig     = str( signature )

        return sig.strip()
</code></pre>

<p>The signature is converted to a string to make it easier to pack it into
structures and also to give us consistent input to the verify()
function.</p>

<p>Verifying the signature requires that we determine if the signature is
ASCII-armoured or not, then comparing a digest of the message to the
signature:</p>

<pre><code>    def verify(key, message, signature):
        try:
            sig     = long( signature )
        except ValueError as e:
            sig     = long( base64.decodestring( signature.rstrip('\n') ), )

        digest      = Crypto.Hash.SHA256.new(message).digest()
        return key.verify( digest, (sig, ) )
</code></pre>

<p>The sign() function returns a signature and the verify() function
returns a boolean. Now, Alice can sign her message to Bob, and Bob knows
the key belongs to Alice. She sends Bob the signature and the encrypted
message. Bob then makes sure Alice’s key properly verifies the signature
to the encrypted message.</p>

<h1>Key Exchange</h1>

<p>So how does Bob know the key actually belongs to Alice? There are two
main schools of thought regarding the authentication of key ownership:
centralised and decentralised. TLS/SSL follow the centralised school: a
root certificate[^1] authority (CA) signs intermediary CA keys, which
then sign user keys. For example, if Bob runs Foo Widgets, LLC, he can
generate an SSL keypair. From this, he generates a certificate signing
request, and sends this to the CA. The CA, usually after taking some
money and ostensibly actually verifying Bob’s identity[^2], then signs
Bob’s certificate. Bob sets up his webserver to use his SSL certificate
for all secure traffic, and Alice sees that the CA did in fact sign his
certificate. This relies on trusted central authorities, like
VeriSign[^3]. Alice’s web browser would ship with a keystore of select
trusted CA public keys (like VeriSigns) that she could use to verify
signatures on the certificates from various sites. This system is called
a public key infrastructure.</p>

<p>The other school of thought is followed by PGP (and GnuPG) - the
decentralised model. In PGP, this is manifested as the <a href="http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust.en.html">Web of
Trust</a>. For example,
if Carol now wants to talk to Bob and gives Bob her public key, Bob
can check to see if Carol’s key has been signed by anyone else.
We’ll also say that Bob knows for a fact that Alice’s key
belongs to Alice, and he trusts her[^4], and that Alice has signed
Carol’s key. Bob sees Alice’s signature on Carol’s key and then can be
reasonably sure that Carol is who she says it was. If we repeat the
process with Dave, whose key was signed by Carol (whose key was signed
by Alice), Bob might be able to be more certain that the key belongs to
Dave, but maybe he doesn’t really trust Carol to properly verify
identities. In PGP, Bob can mark keys as having various trust levels,
and from this a web of trust emerges: a picture of how well you can
trust that a given key belongs to a given user.</p>

<p>The key distribution problem is not a quick and easy problem to
solve; a lot of very smart people have spent a lot of time coming
up with solutions to the problem. There are key exchange protocols
(such as the <a href="http://is.gd/Tr0zLP">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a> and
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange">IKE</a>
(which uses Diffie-Hellman) that provide alternatives to the web
of trust and public key infrastructures.</p>
